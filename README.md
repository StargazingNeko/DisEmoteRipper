# DisRipper

This project is just another Discord Emote/Sticker stealer, possibly soundboards in the future too.

Why?
Cause fuck Discord, thats why. Emotes and stickers should be free.

But such software already exists?
Yep, the ones I tried were slow and had zero indication that they were even working as they don't display their progress on reading servers or anything else.
They're also web/browser based, this runs directly on your Desktop. Plus it was kind of fun to make and learn.
